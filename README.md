# School_District_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is focused on student standardized test scores to determine correlation, including school type, school size, and student funding.  A further analysis was done to exclude an entire class of students at one high school due to suspected cheating and how much or little this effected the outcome of the results.
##Results
o	How is the district summary affected?
	The district summary understandably shows a drop, though it’s fairly minimal with such a small population of 461 students removed from what started as a total student body of 39,170.   We see between a one and two point drop in looking at passing percentages, although the average math and reading scores stay fairly consistent.

o	How is the school summary affected?
	As expected, the breakdown by school has no effect on the other fourteen schools and only Thomas High School (THS) sees a dramatic drop in passing scores. With 28% of the local school population unaccounted for in the results, this is where we’ll see the biggest change in numbers.
o	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
	After removing 461 students from the data due to concerns of cheating in the 9th grade class at THS, the total population changed from 39,170 to 38,709 students with regards to testing results, though funding didn’t change, as those students were still allocated funding for the school year.  This changed the overall passing scores to go from 75% to 73.9% in math and from 85.9% to 84.7% in reading, for an overall passing percentage to fall over a full percentage point, down from 65.2% to 64.1%.
	At a local level, the effects of removing the 9th grade class entirely from THS’s testing results, the overall passing received far more detrimental results, going from 90.9% of the school receiving passing remarks, down to 65.1%

o	How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
	Math and reading scores by grade
•	The reading and math scores for the 10th through 12th grade classes obviously didn’t change, however, there is surprisingly little change between scores for the 9th grade including all students and with the reduced number.  The reading scores only had a variance of point one percent, dropping from 81.9% to 81.8%.  Math scores had similar results, dropping from 78.9% to 78.7%.
	Scores by school spending
•	School spending shows the difference in the $631-645 range as this is the category THS falls into.  Though the trend throughout the data indicates a seemingly dichotomous result of the higher the budget, the lower, the test scores, the downward slope in overall passing performance decreases much more dramatically from the 50th percentile to the 75th percentile.

	Scores by school size
•	This also changes the trend on school size factoring into testing scores.  Previously it appeared that medium sized schools faired the best, possibly due to a large enough classroom to have cohorts to study with but not so large as to be unmanageable for teachers.  As the scores were corrected though, it proved that the larger the school, the lower the overall test scores were.

	Scores by school type
•	Unsurprisingly as THS is a charter school, this also brought down the overall passing percentage from 90% to 87%.

•	Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.

## Summary
As the data shows, removing a specific data set changes how we can view the success of the last year.  There are certain results that don’t change, such as school testing performance by budget, which shows that money is either being allocated in superfluous ways or isn’t being utilized well.  Without knowing exactly how those schools with larger budgets are running the classroom (do all students have iPads but spend too much time on technical difficulties and not on learning the day’s lesson?  Do the classrooms have Smart Boards but the teachers haven’t been trained on how to use them?), the board will need to dig deeper into why these schools are failing.
Changes in the results solidify the anecdotally general consensus that the bigger the school, the more students fall through the cracks.  Teachers aren’t able to devote enough time to all of their students when class sizes reach a certain level, and the corrected data shows the parallels of steady decline in testing scores with the steady incline of school size. 
Though the rest of the changes after correcting test results seem small,such as the district’s overall passing percentages, this can be crucial when it comes time to state budgets and grants, along with local school boosters and volunteering.  Charter schools still show to do better than district schools, despite the corrections, and that’s typically due to parent volunteers and teacher aids.  More data would need to be gathered to know the size of classrooms, number of aids and volunteers on a daily basis, etc. but it gives a starting point to look at where the biggest discrepancies seem to lie; testing results based on school type.
